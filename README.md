Hello NFT
--------------

A very simple 'Hello world' NFT smart contract, referenced by a [blog post in my personal blog](https://sgerogia.github.io/Hello-world-NFT).  
This is packaged as a [Truffle box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box).  

# Installation
`truffle unbox sgerogia/hello_nft_box`

The generated project comes pre-configured with a network named 'ganache'.  
This points to a local instance of the [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) emulator.
